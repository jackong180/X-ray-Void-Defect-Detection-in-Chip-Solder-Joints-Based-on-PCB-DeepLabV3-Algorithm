# X-ray-Void-Defect-Detection-in-Chip-Solder-Joints-Based-on-PCB-DeepLabV3-Algorithm
This repository stores the core source code of the academic article "X-ray Void Defect Detection in Chip Solder Joints Based on PCB-DeepLabV3 Algorithm".
The "deeplabv3_plus" file contains the core code of the attention two-space pyramid network, but it is not the complete code of the entire project.
